# Pongo

Pongo is a modern, mobile-first chat experience built with Flutter and powered by Firebase. It delivers real-time messaging, image sharing, and polished onboarding flows that feel at home on both Android and iOS.

## Overview

Pongo combines Firebase Authentication, Cloud Firestore, and Cloud Storage with a Flutter UI that uses the `dash_chat_2` toolkit and a service-locator architecture (`GetIt`). The result is a responsive chat platform with minimal setup and seamless scalability.

## Features

- **Email & password authentication** – Secure sign-up, login, and logout managed by `firebase_auth`.
- **Real-time conversations** – Firestore-backed chat threads update instantly across devices.
- **Rich media sharing** – Users can upload profile pictures and share gallery images in chats via Firebase Storage.
- **Modern UX** – Gradient-driven themes, dark-mode toggle, searchable contact list, and animated feedback.
- **Service-oriented architecture** – Dedicated services for auth, navigation, alerts, media, storage, and data access registered through `GetIt`.

## Tech Stack

- **Framework** – Flutter (`sdk: ^3.5.2`)
- **Backend** – Firebase (Auth, Firestore, Storage, Analytics)
- **UI Toolkit** – `dash_chat_2`, `google_fonts`
- **Utilities** – `get_it`, `image_picker`, `delightful_toast`, `flutter_native_splash`, `flutter_launcher_icons`

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Flutter SDK installed and configured on your machine.
- Firebase project with Firestore, Authentication, and Storage enabled.

### 1. Clone and install dependencies

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-org>/pongo.git
cd pongo
flutter pub get
```

### 2. Configure Firebase

1. Install the FlutterFire CLI if you have not already:

   ```bash
   dart pub global activate flutterfire_cli
   ```

2. Connect the app to your Firebase project:

   ```bash
   flutterfire configure
   ```

   This command generates the platform-specific configuration and updates `lib/firebase_options.dart`.

3. Download the Firebase config files manually if you prefer:

- `android/app/google-services.json`
- `ios/Runner/GoogleService-Info.plist`
- `macos/Runner/GoogleService-Info.plist` (if supporting macOS)

### 3. Update Firebase rules (optional but recommended)

Deploy the Firestore security rules found in `database.rules.json` to match your deployment needs.

### 4. Run the app

```bash
flutter run
```

## Project Structure

```text
lib/
 ├─ const.dart               # Validation patterns and UI constants
 ├─ firebase_options.dart    # Generated by FlutterFire CLI
 ├─ main.dart                # App entry point, dependency registration
 ├─ utils.dart               # Firebase bootstrap + helper utilities
 ├─ models/                  # Chat, message, and user profile models
 ├─ pages/                   # Login, register, home, and chat screens
 ├─ services/                # Auth, database, storage, media, alerts, navigation
 └─ widgets/                 # Reusable UI components (chat tiles, form fields, search)
```

## Architecture Notes

- **Service Locator (`GetIt`)** – `utils.dart` registers each service as a singleton for easy injection within UI layers.
- **Stateful Pages** – Screens such as `pages/home_page.dart` and `pages/chat_page.dart` maintain UI state, subscribe to Firestore streams, and orchestrate service calls.
- **Message Pipeline** – Chats use `DashChat` widgets backed by Firestore streams; `StorageService` handles media uploads and `DatabaseService` persists `Message` models.

## Customization

- **Splash & Launcher Icons** – Update the assets in `assets/` and run `flutter pub run flutter_native_splash:create` or `flutter pub run flutter_launcher_icons` to regenerate platform assets.
- **Brand Styling** – Modify gradients, typography, and layout in `pages/` and `widgets/` to align with your visual identity.
- **Validation Rules** – Adjust regex constants in `const.dart` to change onboarding requirements.

## Testing & Quality

- Run `flutter analyze` to enforce the lint set defined in `analysis_options.yaml`.
- Add widget or integration tests under `test/` to cover authentication and chat flows.
